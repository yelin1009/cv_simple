    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <article>
    <p>I graduated from Ripon College in 2016 with degrees in Business Management and Global Studies.</p>
    <p>Since then, I worked at various multinational firms and had a chance to collaborate with in-house Software Engineers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We worked together to build a product. I learned the basic product design doing the spec reviews with my colleagues.</p>
    <p>My passion for Software Development started from there. I am currently enrolled at Thinkful as an Engineering Student and would like to use the knowledge I learned here to build web apps in a team setting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I am not coding, I am at the gym lifting a few thousands pounds per sets.</p>
    <p>I love travelling - so far I have been to 12 countries. And I can speak 5 languages! I am fluent in Korean and English and learning to be more proficient in Chinese, French, and Japanese.</p>
