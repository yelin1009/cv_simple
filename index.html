    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="container" >
        <div class="item">
    <p>I graduated from Ripon College in 2016 with degrees in Business Management and Global Studies. Since then, I have worked at several multinational firms and had a chance to work with software engineers. 
    I was collaborating with software engineers to come up with new product features. That was the first spark for my interest in coding. I taught myself how to code in basic HTML5, CSS, and Javascript and decided to enroll with Thinkful to deepen my knowledge.
    I learn the most efficient by doing and taking hands-on advice from industry professionals. Working with other engineers will help me grow to become a better developer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I am not coding, I am at the gym or playing guitar at home. I love learning new languages; I am fluent in English and Korean and learning to become more proficient in Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish. </p>
